My research focuses on understanding the advantages and limitations of generative models and developing practical generative ML models that have low computational complexity and require less human effort. 

## Information Retrieval and Applications

* Interpretable Graph Similarity Computation via Differentiable Optimal Alignment of Node Embeddings (SIGIR 2021 by Doan et al.)
* Efficient Implicit Unsupervised Text Hashing using Adversarial Autoencoder (WWW 2020 by Doan et al.)
* Image Hashing by Minimizing Discrete Component-wise Wasserstein Distance (arxiv 2021 by Doan et al.)
* Generative Hashing Network (*Under submission* 2021 by Doan et al.)
* Generative Cooperative Hashing Network (*Under submission* 2021 by Doan et al.)
* Fast Neural Learning-to-Hash Ranking under NeuralNetwork based Measures  (*Under submission* 2021 by Doan et al.)

## Generative Models

* Image Generation Via Minimizing Frechet Distance in Discriminator Feature Space (*Under submission* 2021 by Doan et al.)
* Regression via implicit models and optimal transport cost minimization (arxiv 2020 by Manchanda et al.)

## AI Backdoor Security with Generative Models

* Backdoor Attack with Imperceptible Input and Latent Modification (*Under submission* 2021 by Doan et al.)
* LIRA: Learnable, Imperceptible and Robust Backdoor Attacks (*Under submission* 2021 by Doan et al.)
