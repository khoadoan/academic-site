abstract: "For a given image generation problem, the intrinsic image manifold is
  often low-dimensional. We use the intuition that it is much better to train
  the GAN generator by minimizing the distributional distance between real and
  generated images in a small dimensional feature space representing such a
  manifold than on the original pixel space. We use the feature space of the GAN
  discriminator for such a representation. For distributional distance, we
  employ one of two choices: the Fr\\'{e}chet distance or direct optimal
  transport (OT); these respectively lead us to two new GAN methods:
  Fr\\'{e}chet-GAN and OT-GAN. The idea of employing Fr\\'{e}chet distance comes
  from the success of Fr\\'{e}chet Inception Distance as a solid evaluation
  metric in image generation. Fr\\'{e}chet-GAN is attractive in several ways. We
  propose an efficient, numerically stable approach to calculate the
  Fr\\'{e}chet distance and its gradient. The Fr\\'{e}chet distance estimation
  requires a significantly less computation time than OT; this allows
  Fr\\'{e}chet-GAN to use a much larger mini-batch size in training than OT.
  More importantly, we conduct experiments on a number of benchmark datasets and
  show that Fr\\'{e}chet-GAN (in particular) and OT-GAN have significantly
  better image generation capabilities than the existing representative primal
  and dual GAN approaches based on the Wasserstein distance."
