I am currently an ML Researcher in the Cognitive Computing Lab at [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/) working with [Dr. Ping Li](http://research.baidu.com/People/index-view?id=111) where we focus on generative models and their applications in Information Retrieval and AI Security. From May 2019 to Feb 2020, I was a member of [Criteo AI Lab](https://ailab.criteo.com/) in Palo Alto, CA, where I was under the supervision of [Dr. Sathiya Keerthi Selvaraj](http://www.keerthis.com/) on generative models. From 2016 to 2021, I was also a member of the [Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence & Data Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/). Before that, I was a faculty member at Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center at University of Maryland, College Park (UMD), with a joint appointment at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. My  work here focused on high-performance and distributed data-analytic system research. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Machine Learning and Data Mining at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), under the supervision of Prof. Chandan K. Reddy. My doctoral research focused on understanding the advantages and limitations of generative models and developing practical generative ML models, especially in information retrieval-related methods, that have low computational complexity and require less human effort. I received my Master Degree in Computer Science, with a focus on high-performance and distributed machine learning, from UMD in 2015. 

I am a Vietnamese native.
